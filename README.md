## Setup

To run the application, you will require a 2-party FireFly system running
locally on ports 5000 & 5001. The easiest way to set this up is with the
[FireFly CLI](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-cli):

```
ff init <ethereum/fabric> myfirefly 2
ff start myfirefly
```

## Running

Once the FireFly stack is ready, you can view it a http://localhost:5000/ui

## Getting started locally

To start developing the UI locally, make sure to have a 2-party FireFly system running locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-ui
cd firefly-ui
npm i
npm run start
```
